For the function findNurse, we wish that patient families could use it to hire a part-time professional nurse.
The nurse who want a part-time job could post their interests and personal information use "addNurse" functionality,
and use "updateNurse" to edit any updates.
Then patient families can use "getAllNurse" to see all of the nurses' information to choose who they want, and if they
want to find the specific one they can use "getNurseByID" functionality.
When nurses once find the employers or don't want to get job anymore, they can delete themselves using "deleteNurse".
This could be achieve by accessing the url: https://healthnextdoor.herokuapp.com/findNurse/

Also, for the above three function, we also keep a functionality called "getXXXByName", we would like to use this
function to return a list of people with the same/similar names with their self-introduction, and when you click
the specific one, you will get to the getXXXByID route to see all the information about him/her. However, we haven't
handled the duplicated name issue, you can just use getXXXByID to search the user right now.
For example, try the url: https://healthnextdoor.herokuapp.com/findNurse/Jennifer_Robbins, to test the getNurseByName,
it will return the overview information of Jennifer Robbins;
and try the url: https://healthnextdoor.herokuapp.com/findNurse/Jennifer_Robbins/10001, to test the getNurseByID,
it will return all of the information about Jennifer Robbins.

For the function of login, we design this function to let the user log in and give access to user homepage in front end
to modify post and password.
These can be login by using "login".
This could be achieve by accessing the url: https://healthnextdoor.herokuapp.com/login/

For the function of signup, we design this function to let the user sign up and give access to user homepage, and user
can make a post as soon as they have an account.
These can be post by using "signup".
This could be achieve by accessing the url: https://healthnextdoor.herokuapp.com/signup/

For the function of updateUser, we design this function to let the patient connect with caregiver by adding their user
name to the sendReq/orderList/receiveReq/historyList. Rating and comment is for patient to giving feedback to the
caregiver. Also, reset password is in that function.
This could be achieve by accessing the url: https://healthnextdoor.herokuapp.com/user/:usernameofuser
For send request, post {action: ["send", "{username of caregiver you want}"]}
https://healthnextdoor.herokuapp.com/user/zqw
e.g. {action: ["send", "www"]}
For accept request, post {action: ["accept", "{username of patient}"]}
https://healthnextdoor.herokuapp.com/user/www

For decline request, post {action: ["decline", "{username of patient}"]}
https://healthnextdoor.herokuapp.com/user/www
