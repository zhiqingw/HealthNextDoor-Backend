For the function discussionForum, we want to build a community to allow it possible for the families helping each other,
and we believe that this function will help family caregivers to relieve stress, get confidence and feel warmth.
We allow our users to use the functionality "addPost" to post their questions,
share their experiences with other users, and use "updatePost" to edit the original post.
If our users want to search a specific post, they can use the functionality called "getPostByName", and if they want to
get to the root of the discussion form and see all of the posts, they can use "getAllPost" as well.
Also, the users would be able to delete their posts as well by using "deletePost".
This could be achieve by accessing the url: https://healthnextdoor.herokuapp.com/discussionForum/

For the function findNurse, we wish that patient families could use it to hire a part-time professional nurse.
The nurse who want a part-time job could post their interests and personal information use "addNurse" functionality,
and use "updateNurse" to edit any updates.
Then patient families can use "getAllNurse" to see all of the nurses' information to choose who they want, and if they
want to find the specific one they can use "getNurseByID" functionality.
When nurses once find the employers or don't want to get job anymore, they can delete themselves using "deleteNurse".
This could be achieve by accessing the url: https://healthnextdoor.herokuapp.com/findNurse/

For the function findPatient and function findVolunteer, we know that there are many families that are not able to
afford the cost of caring for dementia patients, and we also believe in that there are also many volunteers willing to
help those families, so we would like to build a bridge to connect those two types of people.
Our users can register themselves as patient or volunteer by using "addPatient" or "addVolunteer",
and update by the corresponding update methods.
Then they can look through all of the volunteers' or patients' information by using "getAllVolunteer" or
"get AllPatient", or get the specific one using "getVolunteerByID" or "getPatientByID".
Once they have no need for volunteers or don't want to be a volunteer anymore, they can use "deletePatient"
or "deleteVolunteer" to remove their information.
These could be achieve by accessing the url: https://healthnextdoor.herokuapp.com/findPatient/,
or https://healthnextdoor.herokuapp.com/findVolunteer/

Also, for the above three function, we also keep a functionality called "getXXXByName", we would like to use this
function to return a list of people with the same/similar names with their self-introduction, and when you click
the specific one, you will get to the getXXXByID route to see all the information about him/her. However, we haven't
handled the duplicated name issue, you can just use getXXXByID to search the user right now.
For example, try the url: https://healthnextdoor.herokuapp.com/findNurse/Jennifer_Robbins, to test the getNurseByName,
it will return the overview information of Jennifer Robbins;
and try the url: https://healthnextdoor.herokuapp.com/findNurse/Jennifer_Robbins/10001, to test the getNurseByID,
it will return all of the information about Jennifer Robbins.

For the function of Knowledge, we design this function to provide some knowledge for our users to give them
deeper insight about Dementia and teach them some caring skills, which can be different forms,
like video, paper, tutorial session, questionnaire, etc.
These can be post by using "addKnowledge", update by using "updateKnowledge", and delete by using "deleteKnowledge".
Our users can use "getAllKnowledge" to see all of resources, and use "getKnowledgeByName" to search what they want.
This could be achieve by accessing the url: https://healthnextdoor.herokuapp.com/Knowledge/
